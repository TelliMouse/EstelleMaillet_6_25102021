## INSTALLATION ##
For the whole project, you first need to clone the repo at https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/Web-Developer-P6 and follow the instructions in the README file.

Be aware that you'll need a dotenv file to be able to run this app.

Then, clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/TelliMouse/EstelleMaillet_6_25102021.git`.  
Run `npm install`.  
Run either `node server` or `nodemon server` if you've chosen to use nodemon.

The server, the backend of this project, is now running.
